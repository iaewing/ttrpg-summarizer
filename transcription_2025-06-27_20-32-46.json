This is me talking into the voice memos app on my phone, where we're gonna keep talking into, I don't know, maybe, like, thirty two seconds, which is the length of theoretically four eight second recordings. But that should give us enough that we hit the two eight second recordings and then have a third trailing recording, and that should set us to be in a situation where we can effectively test Alright. All the recording scenarios as well as the barge scenario. And that way, I don't have to keep doing this over and over again. You have to listen to it because I could just play it off my phone, and everyone's life becomes much easier. Mostly mine, to be honest, but I'm kind of okay with that. Anyways, bye, Steve.",

All the recording scenarios as well as the barge scenario. And that way, I don't have to keep doing this over and over again.\n\nYou have to listen to it because I could just play it off my phone, and everyone's life becomes much easier.
