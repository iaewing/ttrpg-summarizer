# ðŸ”„ D&D Session Summarizer Plan

## Overview
The app flow is:
1. Record D&D session audio
2. Transcribe with Deepgram (with speaker diarization)
3. Map speakers to players/characters
4. Summarize story with Gemini (or other LLM agent)

## Summary Types
- Session summaries

## Technical Requirements
